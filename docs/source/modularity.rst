Modularity
===========

Our application is structured by a collection of loosely coupled microservices. The benefit of decomposing our application into different smaller services is that it improves modularity and makes the application easier to understand, develop and test, such microservices are
 
* app service
* authentication service
* upload service
* person service
* project service
* storage service
* elastic service
