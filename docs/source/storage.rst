Summary
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The storage feature is the core feature that SDUCloud provides. In this article
we will discover the storage features that are provided by the system.

Navigating Files and Common File Operations (Upload, Copy, Delete, Rename, Move)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To upload a file, the user should move to the files part of SDUCloud using the
menu. The page should look something like this

In the right side there is the possibility to create a new folder or upload a
file. If create a folder is selected, a new folder appears and a name can be
given to to the folder.  If the upload files is selected, the user will be
prompted with the upload dialog window.

Here the user can either drag-and-drop a file or use the browse option to browse
their computer. The user is able to upload one or more files, or a "tar.gz" or ".zip"
file that either can be extracted once uploaded or simply upload as the archive. 
The files will be uploaded to the current folder.

Once a file have been uploaded it will be available to the user. If the file is
selected, a number of options becomes available for the user in the right side
of the screen. These options includes:

- Move
- Copy
- Rename
- Delete
- Download
- Share

These options are also available, in the file dropdown even if the file is not selected.

It is also possible for the user to add a file or folder to their favorits by 
hovering above the file/folder and clicking the small start next to the name 
of the file/folder.

Sharing Files
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To share a file/folder, the user should move to the files part of SDUCloud, and 
select one or more files/folders and click the share option in the right side of 
the screen. The user will then be promted to specify the username of the user he/she 
wants to share these files/folders with. The user should also specify whether the 
recipient should be able to see and modify the shared files/folders or simply only 
be able to see them.

Before the share is completed the recipient also have to accept the share. They
will be notified once the request have been made, and they will be given the option
to either accept or deny the request.

To get an overview of a users shared files and folders, the user can enter the "**Shares**"
part in the menu. Here the user will be able to see all pending and accepted requests.
Here the user will also be able to change the permissions of the files that they are 
sharing with others.

The user who owns the file is of course always in control of the share and can 
revoke it any time he/she wants to. Likewise is the recipient also able to stop being
part of a share, and removing it from their own file system.
