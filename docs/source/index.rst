Introduction
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SDUCloud have been designed and programmed at the eScience Center at the
University Of Southern Denmark. Its components are provided by the open source
community.

The purpose is to provide a user interface that improves the usability of the
HPC environment (Abacus 2.0) for the common user. At the same time it provides a
data storage that secures the data in compliance with GDPR. One of the overall
goals is to improve the searchability for data that are already stored in
SDUCloud. This is done by adding metadata to the stored files in SDUCloud. The
metadata (data about data) are made searchable within the SDUCloud user
interface. Later other search engines can be attached to SDUCloud's metadata
service. Another example of the implementation of "Open Access" is the
integration to Zenodo_.
